# SaveOurShip2Experimental

**READ CAREFULLY AND IN FULL BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

SOS2 EXPERIMENTAL is the maintained version of [Save Our Ship 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909914131). It includes over a years worth of bugfixes, performance optimizations, mechanics changes and some new features that might need more testing.

**While this version is official you use it at your own risk.** It is backwards compatible with the STEAM release however it adds features that might not get adopted into the STEAM version and might cause issues when trying to move from EXPERIMENTAL back to STEAM. While most of these issues can be solved with the dev mode or some minor save editing, no support will be provided in this case.

**Make a separate save while NOT IN A SHIP BATTLE before switching to this version and unsubscribe from SOS2 on STEAM!**

**To download the latest build click above: Code -> Download ZIP.** With major changes a stable build might also be available under Releases.

To update: Make sure to delete the old folder then extract the new one.

**Read the [feature list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSeMCsOtBsbAOLYFbgYUpxyV4ot8L2pSeWMTwzAUCiM/edit#gid=0) for differences between the builds.** It also includes other info that you might find useful.

You can report issues or give feedback here or in #save-our-ship on [Radian Helix Media discord](https://discord.gg/GK7nqgu) - make sure to read the server rules and mention that you are using the experimental build. Check the feature list before reporting and if possible try replicating the bug with only the required mods installed.

An updated version of the Creation kit is also [available](https://github.com/SonicTHI/SaveOurShip2CreationKit). Only use it with SOS2 EXPERIMENTAL.

Also check [the official SOS2 sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT1tWMpG9R7bU6asg5ICf6AmQGzUHmxnL8OPOWFzV1o4L_Dsli6OQbHfFXY4CTxX6vpCEvJjycMPniB/pubhtml) for general SOS2 info, FAQs and mod compatibility. Note that some mods that do work with the STEAM build might not with SOS2 EXPERIMENTAL - particularly mods that alter, extend or otherwise interact with SOS2.
