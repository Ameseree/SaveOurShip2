# SaveOurShip2Experimental

**READ CAREFULLY AND IN FULL BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

SOS2 EXPERIMENTAL is the maintained version of [Save Our Ship 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909914131). It includes bugfixes, changes and new features that need more testing.

While this version is official you use it at your own risk. It is backwards compatible with the STEAM release however it adds features that might not get adopted into the STEAM version and might cause issues when trying to move from EXPERIMENTAL back to STEAM. While most of these issues can be solved with the dev mode or some minor save editing, no support will be provided in this case. **Make sure to save your game NOT IN COMBAT before switching to this version.**

Read the [feature list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSeMCsOtBsbAOLYFbgYUpxyV4ot8L2pSeWMTwzAUCiM/edit#gid=0) for differences between the builds. It also includes other info that you might find usefull.

If you do not know what to do with these files or where to put them do not bother with this and stick to the STEAM version.

To update: Make sure to delete the old folder then extract the new one.

**Download the source (Code -> Download ZIP) for the latest build.**

You can report issues or give feedback here or in #save-our-ship on [Radian Helix Media discord](https://discord.gg/GK7nqgu) - make sure to mention that you are using the experimental build. Check the feature list before reporting. If you encounter bugs or issues not directly related to changed or added features please try replicating the bug with the STEAM build.

An updated version of the Creation kit is also [available](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i12ryPcQETc68eMPxp19QcDQloz7Pm3x/view?usp=sharing). Only use it with SOS2 EXPERIMENTAL.
